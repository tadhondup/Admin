### 3. Approve the RFC
The Job Owner reviews the RFC and meets with the Team Lead to go over it. Once the Job Owner is satisfied with the Team Lead's plan, the Job Owner signs off on the RFC.

### 4. Create a repository
The Team Lead creates a job repository, updates its readme file, and transfers the RFC to the new repo.

### 5. Create a Github project and milestones
The Team Lead creates a Github project for the job. Then they create milestones based on the key phases of the RFC's detailed plan.

### 6. Convert work plan items into issues
The Team Lead converts each item in the RFC work plan into an issue and assigns it to both the job's repository and project.

### 7. Assign issues to the team

### 8. Assign milestones to issues

### 9. Do the work and create pull requests
